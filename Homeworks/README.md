## Homework 1
Basic examination of span, examining reduced forms. Using row reduction we find under which circumstances we have solutions, etc.
## Homework 2
An application.We're trying to find whether under certain circumstances we can guarantee that we can reach certain points on the plane. More on span, linear dependence
## Homework 3
Lots on span, but now with a emphasis on using RREF and analyzing the results, starting to look at how the determinant can provide insight
## Homework 4
Starting to get in to the meat and potatos. A strict definition arising from examination for linear transformations.
## Homework 5
An application. We're describing people moving between rooms by certain paths. Then coming up with general form and seeing how the nullspace arose from the solutions.
## Homework 6
Really heavily in to the interrealtionships between rank, nullity, nullspace, column space, and row space. There's a few of these, along with an intro to rank one matrices, and another nullspace example taken from a graph.
## Homework 7
Eigenvectors and eignenvalues show up as a way of stretching. Lots of changes of bases. M
